Yes, this exists ~~because of DT~~
# How 2 compile???
Thats simple actually
1. Click that green download button to get a .zip file
2. Extract the "behaviors" and "resources" folders
3. Compress the folders into a .zip file (which you can name to whatever you want)
4. Change the ".zip" to ".mcaddon"
5. Click on the newly renamed file to import it to Minecraft
And there you go. Only problem is that doing so may give you a buggy version not fit for release, so trust the [releases tab](https://github.com/ANightDazingZoroark/Prehistoric-Rift-Addon/releases) for a stable version 
# Editing
* Make sure that the code is readable
* Vanilla spawn eggs are formatted as Spawn ((insert mob name here)). This should also apply to the addon's own custom mobs
* Make sure to put a comma after every statement in the json files (unless it's the last one). For instance, the splash texts file
* Don't edit this file or else you will be tortured forever
  * Borgy is the only exception to this rule since he made this
# Issues
* Make sure to give an issue the correct label
* Don't make the title too vague
* Don't delete issues. It's pointless anyway, just close them instead
