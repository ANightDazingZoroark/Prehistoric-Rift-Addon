Yes, this exists ~~because of DT~~
# How 2 compile???
Thats simple actually. Just click that green button to get a .zip file. Once done, go to the folder where it got downloaded into, then change the ".zip" to ".mcaddon". Just note that doing so gives you a really high chance of giving you a quite messy version of the addon.
# Editing
* Make sure that the code is readable
* Vanilla spawn eggs are formatted as Spawn ((insert mob name here)). This should also apply to the addon's own custom mobs
* Make sure to put a comma after every statement in the json files (unless it's the last one). For instance, the splash texts file
* Don't edit this file or else you will be tortured forever
  * Borgy is the only exception to this rule since he made this
# Issues
* Make sure to give an issue the correct label
* Don't make the title too vague
