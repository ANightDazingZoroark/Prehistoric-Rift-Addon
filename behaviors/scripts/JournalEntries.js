All the poor things can even do is run away.\n\nThere still seems to be some hope. Polar Bears don't seem to be frightened of the creatures of the Rift, but that doesn't mean anything when a giant carnivore can kill you in one hit. And most of the animals that give out food can at least be bred in captivity.\n\nMy research has shown that some of the creatures of the Rift drop meat that is far more nutritious than those of the regular animals. There's definitely no hope for the poor regular animals at all in the near future. Which is quite sad.")

Not because the corals are annoying to swim through, but because you aren't sure if an Anomalocaris will come over to attack. You can't even see them normally, you have to attack them first to expose them.\n\nAnything around the size of a human or smaller gets the short end of the stick if face to face with these because they prefer to grab them and drag them around as they drain their health. Even the larger creatures can get their health sapped by these.\n\nTrying to spot one is a nightmare. I've had to squint my eyes real hard on multiple occasions just to figure out their location through the invisibility particles they produce. I don't even want to think of an alternate universe where they don't do that.")

I gotta be thankful for that. I've seen them smash Utahraptors in one go in the wild. That means they're not to be messed with, no doubt about it.\n\nThe good thing is that they're very slow, and will wimp out when they're low on health.\n\nPillagers are known to use Apatosauruses to carry cannons and other heavy destructive weapons for raids. Even if they run out of ammunition for their weapons, their sheer power lets them break houses by just walking into them.\n\nThey're really great for harvesting lots of wood from entire forests. They might as well even destroy entire forests from such endeavors.")

The inverted temperature even gets redirected to the fangs, allowing it to slow down and weaken targets with a frost bite in hot temperatures and set targets aflame with overheating fangs in cold temperatures.\n\nBest used for egg incubation.

There's no way to mask your scent, as far as my knowledge is concerned.\n\nThe best part about them as a mount is that there's no need for a saddle! If you're out in the snowy areas all by yourself you can just kill a couple creatures and tame a Direwolf to help out! Too bad they can't carry chests.\n\nI've seen certain Direwolves transform into giant monstrous forms at night. In such a state, they are more powerful and have access to more powerful abilities, such as their destructive blows and ability to break blocks. You can tell if they can do so by seeing if they emit particles by day.")

Their bites are far stronger than most of the apex predators, so be thankful that that's all they eat.\n\nBy daytime, they go to sleep. They don't have much competition so they can at least sleep peacefully. People who think they're funny would rudely awaken them from time to time. While they're at least safe because they aren't that strong in the day, it's still rude anyway.\n\nUpon eating enough monsters or bugs, they will emit a light blast that will damage most surrounding monsters.\n\nCaves tend to be full of Saurophaganaxes.
