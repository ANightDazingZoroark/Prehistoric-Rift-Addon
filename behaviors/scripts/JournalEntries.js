.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Herbivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 3\nFavorite Treats: Leafy Treat, Grassy Treat, Berry Treat\n\nProbably the first large creature I've seen that won't kill on sight. I gotta be thankful for that. I've seen them smash Utahraptors in one go in the wild. That means they're not to be messed with, no doubt about it.\n\nThe good thing is that they're very slow, and will wimp out when they're low on health.\n\nPillagers are known to use Apatosauruses to carry cannons and other heavy destructive weapons for raids. Even if they run out of ammunition for their weapons, their sheer power lets them break houses by just walking into them.\n\nThey're really great for harvesting lots of wood from entire forests. They might as well even destroy entire forests from such endeavors.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Carnivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 2\nFavorite Treats: Fish Treat, Flesh Treat\n\nBaryonyxes prefer being around rivers. They prefer eating fish, but eat some of the land creatures from time to time.\n\nTheir claws can inject poison into their targets, but their skin is poisonous too. Might not seem much at first, but the water lets that poison spread. They're why I don't swim a lot.\n\nThey have a great affinity for fishing, and every once in a while they might end up catching something rare from the water.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Carnivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 2\nFavorite Treats: Fish Treat, Flesh Treat\n\nI forgot how many times I have confused these things for Spinosauruses, yet here we are.\n\nThe sail inverts its internal and external temperature which also applies to its surroundings. The inverted temperature even gets redirected to the fangs, allowing it to slow down and weaken targets with a frost bite in hot temperatures and set targets aflame with overheating fangs in cold temperatures.\n\nBest used for egg incubation. Way better than having to manually bring eggs to random far off places.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Carnivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 2\nFavorite Treats: Flesh Treat\n\nFar more vicious than the regular wolf. Packs are far deadlier because one of the members will boost the damage and speed of all the others.\n\nTheir keen sense of smell lets them identify what mobs might be nearby. There's no way to mask your scent, as far as my knowledge is concerned.\n\nThe best part about them as a mount is that there's no need for a saddle! If you're out in the snowy areas all by yourself you can just kill a couple creatures and tame a Direwolf to help out! Too bad they can't carry chests.\n\nI've seen certain Direwolves transform into giant monstrous forms at night. In such a state, they are more powerful and have access to more powerful abilities, such as their destructive blows and ability to break blocks. You can tell if they can do so by seeing if they emit particles by day.")

Each individual's behavior depends, they're either skittish or they will retaliate if attacked.\n\nSometimes they will fight amongst each other. I don't know why they do this, its detrimental in the long run when you think about it.\n\nThe antlers let them forage apples and saplings from trees and rip off thatch from the bark.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Herbivore\nBehavior: Passive\nTaming Tier: Tier 1\nFavorite Treats: Rooted Treat, Grassy Treat, Berry Treat\n\nIf you see one, expect to see others in the area. They look out for each other, and protect each other from predators by using their horns to alert others about danger. Once there's danger, they'll run away.\n\nWhen in direct danger they might emit a shockwave that can paralyze mobs for a short time before fleeing.\n\nThey really like eating the truffles that have been appearing more frequently and can dig them up from grass. Though it seems they like uprooting rooted crops too")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Carnivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 2\nFavorite Treats: Carrion Treat, Bug Treat\n\nNighttime feels much safer as long as these creatures exist. They eat monsters and bugs instead of animals and humans, which is something in of itself. Their bites are far stronger than most of the apex predators, so be thankful that that's all they eat.\n\nBy daytime, they go to sleep. They don't have much competition so they can at least sleep peacefully. People who think they're funny would rudely awaken them from time to time. While they're at least safe because they aren't that strong in the day, it's still rude anyway.\n\nUpon eating enough monsters or bugs, they will emit a light blast that will damage most surrounding monsters.\n\nCaves tend to be full of Saurophaganaxes. No sunlight and an abundance of food items down there means it's a free for all for them.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Herbivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 1\nFavorite Treats: Rooted Treat, Grassy Treat, Berry Treat\n\nPlates all over and spikes on the tail is enough to say that they're a tank. Which it is, in fact.\n\nIf given enough time, they can charge up their tail attacks to deal more damage. Usage tires them out easily.\n\nThe plates protect the rider from falling off and keeps them safe from most attacks. The tail is the main weapon of the creature. The spikes can puncture through skin, while the small plates can be thrown and can hurt the target.\n\nThe spikes also make for a great tool for farming wheat, berries, and even dyes from flowers.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Herbivore\nBehavior: Neutral\nTaming Tier: Tier 1\nFavorite Treats: Rooted Treat, Grassy Treat, Berry Treat\n\nTriceratopses are really friendly, and its best if one maintains that friendliness with them because those horns hurt quite a lot. And they can break blocks.\n\nThey like it if someone tickles the back of their frills near the neck. I think most Triceratopses agree with this part.\n\nUpon seeing an apex predator or anything really aggressive and threatening, it enters a rivalry buff mode that grants them strength and resistance.\n\nThe horns let them forage apples, leaves, and saplings from trees and rip off thatch from the bark.")

.body("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet: Carnivore\nBehavior: Hostile\nTaming Tier: Tier 3\nFavorite Treats: Flesh Treat, Carrion Treat\n\nThe strongest creature ever brought about by the Rift. No need for help from others or weird gimmicks. Just pure raw strength, power, and bulk. This creature is basically the gold standard for being powerful.\n\nI'm not sure if that's an exaggeration really. All known methods to kill a mob work on a Tyrannosaurus as well, but are just more time consuming expensive.\n\nThey don't seem to be hostile all the time. There's times when they will just peacefully walk around.\n\nThe knockback roar they emit when hurt is quite a pain, able to hurl back mobs and even break blocks.")

Packs are far deadlier because one of the members will boost the damage and speed of all the others.\n\nThey attack in two ways. One is through their claws, and the other is through pouncing upon their target. Both are deadly.\n\nTaming them is relatively cheap. Nearly everyone I know relies on one because they're fast, are great swimmers, can climb walls, and do reliable damage.")
