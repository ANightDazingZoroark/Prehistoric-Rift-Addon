Polar Bears don't seem to be frightened of the creatures of the Rift, but that doesn't mean anything when a giant carnivore can kill you in one hit. And most of the animals that give out food can at least be bred in captivity.\n\nMy research has shown that some of the creatures of the Rift drop meat that is far more nutritious than those of the regular animals. There's definitely no hope for the poor regular animals at all in the near future. Which is quite sad.")

It gets to hide inside it from all kinds of danger, for free, without any need to run to some safe zone. Best part is that the spikes that surround it serve as a defensive mechanism that hurts anything that tries to get close to it.\n\nThe tail happens to have a tough club, which it can use as a weapon. It's tough enough to smash stone and bones. Perfect for mining up mountains for stone and other valuable ores.\n\nThe shell is way too durable. Melee weapons and attacks from other mobs don't do a lot to it, and projectiles can't penetrate it. The only thing that can even penetrate that tough shell is TNT or splash potions.")

Not because the corals are annoying to swim through, but because you aren't sure if an Anomalocaris will come over to attack. You can't even see them normally, you have to attack them first to expose them.\n\nAnything around the size of a human or smaller gets the short end of the stick if face to face with these because they prefer to grab them and drag them around as they drain their health. Even the larger creatures can get their health sapped by these.\n\nTrying to spot one is a nightmare. I've had to squint my eyes real hard on multiple occasions just to figure out their location through the invisibility particles they produce. I don't even want to think of an alternate universe where they don't do that.")

I gotta be thankful for that. I've seen them smash Utahraptors in one go in the wild. That means they're not to be messed with, no doubt about it.\n\nThe good thing is that they're very slow, and will wimp out when they're low on health.\n\nPillagers are known to use Apatosauruses to carry cannons and other heavy destructive weapons for raids. Even if they run out of ammunition for their weapons, their sheer power lets them break houses by just walking into them.\n\nThey're really great for harvesting lots of wood from entire forests. They might as well even destroy entire forests from such endeavors.")

And honestly, I'm probably never looking back on it. Most people in plains biomes can obtain the materials required for a flesh treat within a day or two, and have a couple of these things as companions later on.\n\nI reckon these to be the go-to tame for those who end up in the Plains biomes before being able to ride anything.

And it's through spitting a sticky substance that poisons and blinds their targets. Or through their not so impressive bite attacks.\n\nThey prefer to hide in thick forests where they're less likely to be seen and where their prey has less space to maneuver around their spits.\n\nOccasionally they vomit out poisonous puddles on the floor. It's basically a mixture of their poisonous saliva, mixed up food, and gunpowder. Anything that steps on them gets exploded on and gets poisoned. It's very obviously their vomit, but it looks like they know that it makes for a great trapping material too.")

The inverted temperature even gets redirected to the fangs, allowing it to slow down and weaken targets with a frost bite in hot temperatures and set targets aflame with overheating fangs in cold temperatures.\n\nBest used for egg incubation.

Packs are far deadlier because one of the members will boost the damage and speed of all the others.\n\nTheir keen sense of smell lets them identify what mobs might be nearby. There's no way to mask your scent, as far as my knowledge is concerned.\n\nThe best part about them as a mount is that there's no need for a saddle! If you're out in the snowy areas all by yourself you can just kill a couple creatures and tame a Direwolf to help out! Too bad they can't carry chests.\n\nI've seen certain Direwolves transform into giant monstrous forms at night. In such a state, they are more powerful and have access to more powerful abilities, such as their destructive blows and ability to break blocks. You can tell if they can do so by seeing if they emit particles by day.")

They don't have much competition so they can at least sleep peacefully. People who think they're funny would rudely awaken them from time to time.
