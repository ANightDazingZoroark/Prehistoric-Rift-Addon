This creature is basically the gold standard for being powerful.\n\nI'm not sure if that's an exaggeration really. All known methods to kill a mob work on a Tyrannosaurus as well, but are just more time consuming expensive.\n\nThe knockback roar they emit when hurt is quite a pain, able to hurl back mobs and even break blocks.")
